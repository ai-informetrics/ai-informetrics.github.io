      <h2 align="left">Purpose of the Workshop</h2>
        <p align="justify">Driven by the big data boom, <em>informetrics</em>, known as the study of quantitative aspects of information, has gained great benefits from <em>artificial intelligence</em> (Nilsson 1998) – including a wide range of intelligent agents through techniques such as neural networks, genetic programming, computer vision, heuristic search, knowledge representation and reasoning, Bayes network, planning and language understanding. With its capacities in analyzing unstructured scalable data and streams, understanding uncertain semantics, and developing robust and repeatable models, &ldquo;<em>Artificial Intelligence + Informetrics</em>&rdquo; has demonstrated enormous success in turning big data into big value and impact by handling diverse challenges raised from multiple disciplines and research areas. For example, bibliometric-enhanced information retrieval (Mayr et al., 2014), science mapping with topic models (Suominen and Toivanen, 2016), streaming data analytics for tracking technological change (Zhang et al., 2017), and entity extraction with unsupervised machine learning techniques (Zhang and Zhang, 2019). Such endeavours with broadened perspectives from machine intelligence would portend far-reaching implications for science (Fortunato et al., 2018), but how to effectively cohere the power of AI and informetrics to create cross-disciplinary solutions is still elusive from neither theoretical nor practical perspectives.<br> </p>
        <p>This workshop is to gather researchers and practical users to open a collaborative platform for exchanging ideas, sharing pilot studies, and scoping future directions on this cutting-edge venue. We highlight &ldquo;<strong><em>AI + Informetrics</em></strong>&rdquo; as endeavors in constructing fundamental theories, developing novel methodologies, bridging conceptual knowledge with practical uses, and creating real-word solutions.        Specific examples of fields of interest include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Informetrics with machine learning (including deep learning)</li>
          <li>Informetrics with natural language processing or computational linguistics</li>
          <li>Informetrics with computer vision</li>
          <li>Informetrics with other related AI techniques (e.g., information retrieval)</li>
          <li>AI for science of science</li>
          <li>AI for science, technology, &amp; innovation</li>
          <li>AI for research policy and strategic management</li>
          <li>Applications of AI-enhanced informetrics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 align="left">Programme</h2>
        <h5 align="left"><strong>1st Keynote</strong>: <strong>AI and Science of Science</strong>        </h5>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fundamentally changed every aspect of our lives. In AI, the half life of a paper could be less than one year which means that new algorithms have been developed and become out of date within just one year, sometimes could be just few months. Computer vision leads the newly development of fansinating AI algorithms, which are then diffused to natural language processing and graph mining. AI has challenged our understandings of collaboration, knoweldge diffusion, and even citing behavior. The new concepts of human-machine teaming, cognitive computing in knowledge diffusion, citing future rather past are all happening right now at the AI era. This talk will highlight several research practices and share the thoughts about the current and future of AI and Science of Science.<br>
