CALL FOR PAPER
AI + Informetrics: Multi-disciplinary Interactions in the Era of Big Data
You are invited to participate in the 1st Workshop on AI + Informetrics (AII2021) to be held as a virtual event as part of the iConference 2021 in Beijing, China on March 28-31, 2021. See https://ischools.org/Program

Purpose of the Workshop
Driven by the big data boom, informetrics, known as the study of quantitative aspects of information, has gained great benefits from artificial intelligence (Nilsson 1998) – including a wide range of intelligent agents through techniques such as neural networks, genetic programming, computer vision, heuristic search, knowledge representation and reasoning, Bayes network, planning and language understanding. With its capacities in analyzing unstructured scalable data and streams, understanding uncertain semantics, and developing robust and repeatable models, “Artificial Intelligence + Informetrics” has demonstrated enormous success in turning big data into big value and impact by handling diverse challenges raised from multiple disciplines and research areas. For example, bibliometric-enhanced information retrieval (Mayr et al., 2014), science mapping with topic models (Suominen and Toivanen, 2016), streaming data analytics for tracking technological change (Zhang et al., 2017), and entity extraction with unsupervised machine learning techniques (Zhang et al., 2019). Such endeavours with broadened perspectives from machine intelligence would portend far-reaching implications for science (Fortunato et al., 2018), but how to effectively cohere the power of AI and informetrics to create cross-disciplinary solutions is still elusive from neither theoretical nor practical perspectives.
This workshop is to gather researchers and practical users to open a collaborative platform for exchanging ideas, sharing pilot studies, and scoping future directions on this cutting-edge venue. We highlight “AI + Informetrics” as endeavors in constructing fundamental theories, developing novel methodologies, bridging conceptual knowledge with practical uses, and creating real-word solutions.
*Interests to this workshop include, but not limited to the following topics:
•	Informetrics with machine learning (including deep learning)
•	Informetrics with natural language processing or computational linguistics
•	Informetrics with computer vision
•	Informetrics with other related AI techniques (e.g., information retrieval)
•	AI for science of science
•	AI for science, technology, & innovation
•	AI for research policy and strategic management
•	Applications of AI-enhanced informetrics

Submission Guidelines
All papers must follow the guidelines on iConference’s Author Instructions Page. 
Length
Up to 6,000 words (excluding references) in Springer’s prescribed LNCS template
Submissions 
Easychair
Timeline
Submission deadline: Feb 15, 2021
Notification date: Feb 28, 2021
Final camera-ready versions due: March 7, 2021

Review Process
All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. Please be aware of the fact that once the paper is accepted, at least one author per paper needs to register for the workshop and attend the workshop to present the work. In light of the recent events regarding the Coronavirus, AII2021 will be an all-virtual workshop as iConference will be online only.
Workshop proceedings will be deposited online in the CEUR workshop proceedings publication service. This way the proceedings will be permanently available and citable (digital persistent identifiers and long-term preservation).

Special Issues
Potential target journals for our special issues include Scientometrics, Journal of Informetrics, Journal of Data and Information Science, and Frontiers in Research Metrics and AnalyticsI.
